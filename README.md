**CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python**

An introduction to programming using a language called Python. Learn how
to read and write code as well as how to test and "debug" it. Designed
for students with or without prior programming experience who'd like to
learn Python specifically. Learn about functions, arguments, and return
values (oh my!); variables and types; conditionals and Boolean
expressions; and loops. Learn how to handle exceptions, find and fix
bugs, and write unit tests; use third-party libraries; validate and
extract data with regular expressions; model real-world entities with
classes, objects, methods, and properties; and read and write files.
Hands-on opportunities for lots of practice. Exercises inspired by
real-world programming problems. No software required except for a web
browser, or you can write code on your own PC or Mac.

Whereas [<u>CS50x</u>](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) itself
focuses on computer science more generally as well as programming with
C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, this course, aka CS50P, is entirely
focused on programming with Python. You can take CS50P before CS50x,
during CS50x, or after CS50x. But for an introduction to computer
science itself, you should still take CS50x!
